# Use JSDoc for documentation generation

## Context and Problem Statement

- We need to generate documentation for our code.
- Don't have time to create a wiki ourselves
- Wan't to use our existing code comments to generate documentation
    - Simple and lightweight

## Considered Options

- Host a wiki page for our repo
- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)", because it is simple and
lightweight and we can use our existing code comments to generate documentation.
Also, it forces us to write good comments and code documentations and code that
is self-explanatory.
