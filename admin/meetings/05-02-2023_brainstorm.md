### Brainstorming

- 8-Ball Expansion
    - Terror (Noodle) Cards
        - Pros:
            - Adds variety to our fortune telling.
            - Output response bank will be very extensive.
        - Cons:
            - Needs a lot of custom card images.
            - Large response bank can be hard to make.
    - Horoscope (Noodle by Month)
        - Pros:
            - Adds more user input so it seems more personal to the user.
            - Responses generated are influenced by a hash function based on the date so output isn't deterministic.
            - Has a old user button for continuing users (aka has memory of previous fortunes).
    - Fortune Cookie
        - Pros:
            - Has a variety of features we can implement.
              - Ex: Add in lucky lottery numbers.
              - Ex: Add in a future lucky day the user will get.
        - Cons:
            - Very little user input.
