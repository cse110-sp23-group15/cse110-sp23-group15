### 2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

All members will be expected to read emails, group conversations, and Slack important announcements from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 12 hours.

### 3) Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)

Team will agree, at the end of each class, to set any meeting times and agenda needed before the next class and beyond if possible. Team members will take turns to send out a reminder of the meeting with an agenda to do within eight hours after the class, preferably in-person. If a member cannot attend a meeting in-person, the member can join through a zoom meeting.

Team meetings:

Tuesdays after class - 6:30 - 7:30pm (Full House)

Thursdays after class - 6:30pm - 7:30pm (Front & Back)

### 4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members

This element of the team working agreement is the list of rules/agreements or the contract that all members agree to live by.

Frontend (Hieu): Anthony, Holly, Hanson

Backend (Mark): Aaron, Steve, Xinle, Darren

### 5) Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines _(Optional)_

This section may be updated later

### 6) Conflict Resolution

Each team should have an agreed-upon approach to addressing issues that may arise. _For example, if a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to do X [specific action decided by the team] to address the problem before bringing the issue to a TA or professor._

If a team member has a direct conflict with another team member, it is encouraged to resolve the conflict directly between the two parties. If a resolution cannot be reached, a team leader must be contacted to help resolve the conflict.

If a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to bring the issue up to the team leads. The team leads are responsible for organizing a meeting with the team member to discuss the conflict.

### 7) Expectations of Faculty and GTA's

###
_If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues._

If the team needs help, the TA's must be present to provide assistance to the team as needed.
