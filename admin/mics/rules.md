# Group Contract

TODO:

> To verify agreement to what the contract defines, every group member will have
> to upload a signed copy (PDF) of the rules to the repo.

> Place your team rules in your repo at /admin/misc/rules.md and then each
> member should add their version named as /admin/misc/rules-studentname.pdf and
> it should include a signed version of the printed rules. If I was on your
> team my file would /admin/misc/rules-thomaspowell.pdf as an example of the
> format.
